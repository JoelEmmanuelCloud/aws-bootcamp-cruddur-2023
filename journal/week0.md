## I was able to set Enviromental Variables for my cloud credentials.
Environment variables provide another way to specify configuration credentials

I was able to set Enviromental Variables for my credentials by following this examples on the [AWS Enviroment Variables doc page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```
