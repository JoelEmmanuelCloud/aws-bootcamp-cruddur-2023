# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

# Required Homework 

## I was able to install and use AWS CLI on giptod.
I followed these steps from the [AWS command line docs and userguide page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#cliv2-linux-install) to install the AWS CLI on gitpod.

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

Here's a image of what it looked like after intallation.

## I was able to set Enviromental Variables for my cloud credentials.
Environment variables provide another way to specify configuration credentials

I was able to set Enviromental Variables for my credentials by following this examples on the [AWS Enviroment Variables doc page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2
```
Here's a image of the my output after setting Enviromental Variables and calling the Caller-identity

## Creating Billing Alarms.

I create a two billing alarms to notify me each time I exceed my budget spend.
I set the budget limit at $1 because I can't afford any extra spend outside the AWS free tier at the moment.
